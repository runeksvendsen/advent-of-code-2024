# Advent of Code 2024

The repository in which I solve a small number of 2024 Advent of Code challenges in Haskell, until I realize I'd rather be working on more useful stuff.

## Running

Each solution is an executable file, which depends on [cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), and accepts input via stdin.

Steps to run:

1. Install [cabal-install](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/).
2. Execute the solution file in question, feeding it input via stdin, e.g.:
   * ```
     ./01.hs < input.txt
     ```

### Using Nix

1. Enter the Nix shell by running `nix-shell`
2. Run step 2 above
